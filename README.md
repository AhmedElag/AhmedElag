## About Me
I build systems across **hardware, software, and the web**.  
My work ranges from low-level digital design and embedded projects to full-stack applications and deployed websites.

I’m especially interested in how systems work **end-to-end** — from logic and architecture, to implementation, testing, and real-world behavior.

## Education
**Wilfrid Laurier University**  
Bachelor of Science — **Computer Science**  
Concentration: **Big Data Systems**  
Minor: **Psychology**

My academic background combines technical system design with an understanding of human behavior, decision-making, and interaction — shaping how I approach both software and hardware projects.

## Areas of Focus
- Digital systems and RTL design (VHDL, FSMs, counters, timing logic)
- Embedded and IoT systems (sensors, GPIO, hardware integration)
- Data-driven systems and large-scale computation
- Software development and automation
- Full-stack and web applications
- System verification, simulation, and testing
---

## Selected Work
- **Digital Systems & Hardware Projects**  
  Clocked designs, counters, FSMs, and RTL-level implementations verified through simulation and schematic tools.

- **Embedded & IoT Systems**  
  Sensor integration, GPIO control, and real-time hardware–software interaction on platforms like Raspberry Pi.

- **Software & Web Applications**  
  Full-stack projects, deployed websites, and data-oriented tools spanning backend and frontend development.

## How I Think About Building
I value **clean architecture**, **clear documentation**, and **verifiable behavior**.  
Whether working in hardware or software, I focus on building systems that are understandable, testable, and robust.

I’m particularly drawn to projects where low-level technical decisions have visible, real-world impact.
